# SAMD_DMA_SPI
A small library to allow SPI transfer using DMA controller. The mail purpose is to remove the delay between each byte sent in a SPI write.

The library is based on a code that was found on a forum. I forgot where was it, if known, please edit this file and add the original source (make a PR)

Currently tested and working on **Nano 33 IoT** board
