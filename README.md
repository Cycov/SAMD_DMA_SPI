# SAMD_DMA_SPI
A small library to allow SPI transfer using DMA controller. The main purpose is to remove the delay between each byte sent in a SPI write but also to achieve the maximum speed possible on the SAMD chip family

The library is based on a code that was found on a forum. I forgot where was it, if known, please edit this file and add the original source (make a PR)

Currently tested and working on **Nano 33 IoT** board
